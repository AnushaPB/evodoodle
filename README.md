# Evodoodle

Evodoodle is a drawing game for learning how evolution plays out across landscapes. Draw your own custom landscapes and then watch as your species evolves across them! Evodoodle allows you to control population density, connectivity, and selection across space and then simulates evolution using Geonomics, a powerful landscape genomic simulating package.
