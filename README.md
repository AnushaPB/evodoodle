# Evodoodle

Draw your own custom landscapes and watch as your species evolves across them! Evodoodle is a drawing game for learning how evolution plays out across landscapes. Evodoodle allows you to control population density, connectivity, and selection across space and then simulates evolution using Geonomics, a powerful landscape genomic simulation package.

# Setup
