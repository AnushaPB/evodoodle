    "1. You are consulting with a conservation organization that is trying to decide whether to build (Option 1) a large, connected, single preserve or (Option 2) several, smaller, disconnected preserves. Design a simulation (or a set of simulations) to help them make their decision. Bonus challenge: try and simulate one scenario where option (1) is best and one scenario where (2) is best (Hint: think about different things you might want to conserve)\n",

    "2. Wildlife corridors are a popular method for restoring connectivity between areas fragmented by human development, such as roads. Create a simulation (or a pair of simulations) that shows the effect of a wildlife corridor across a hypothetical road on genetic diversity. What happens if the corridor connects two very different environments?\n",

    "3. Your friend comes to you super excited because they just analyzed their landscape genetics data on hedgehogs and found a super clear gradient in PC values that aligns with a gradient in temperature. They tell you that they think this is an indication that hedgehogs are locally adapted to temperature. What do you think? Can you come up with a simulation to show your friend what else could be causing this pattern?\n",

    "4. So far, we have only used the evodoodle default simulation parameters; this means that for all of our simulations, we have used the same underlying species parameters (e.g., number of offspring, longevity, etc.). What are some species parameters that might be important to test? Pick one of the scenarios above and describe two parameters you might want to evaluate in your simulations. \n",
    "Some example parameters you might want to consider:\n",
    "- Movement/dispersal rates\n",
    "- Longevity (i.e., maximum age)\n",
    "- Number of offspring per mating event\n",
    "- Mutation rates\n",
    "- Selection strength\n",
    "- Mating radius\n",
    "- Mutation rates\n",
    "Explain why you picked these parameters and hypothesize what you might expect to see if you changed them. Your hypothesis does not have to be \"correct\", it just has to be testable and justified."
